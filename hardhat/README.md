## Mint your own NFT collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off

Use of an NFT fullstack application

The project let users connect their Ethereum wallet, and mint an NFT to their wallet so they actually own it. They'll even be able to re-sell the NFT on OpenSea. The NFT itself can be customized to whatever you want.

### Smart Contract Part

Create a `.env` file on root of the project with these lines:

- RINKEBY_ALCHEMY_DEV_KEY = 'Your Alchemy App API Key for Testnet'
- RINKEBY_ALCHEMY_PROD_KEY = 'Your Alchemy App API Key for Mainnet'
- PRIVATE_KEY = 'Your Metamask private key'
